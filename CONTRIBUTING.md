# YetiBot loves pull requests.

1. Fork the repo.

2. Add your contributions on `master`, preferrebly as logically grouped commits with
[well-formed commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

### Tests

Tests are appreciated, especially when there's logic beyond a simple API call.

### Style

Please adhere to YetiBot's existing conventions. A few nitpicks
are 2 spaces and no trailing whitespace.
