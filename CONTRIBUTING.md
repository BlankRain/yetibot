# yetibot loves pull requests

1. Fork the repo.
2. Add your contributions on the `master` branch of your fork as logically grouped commits with
   [well-formed commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
3. Rebase on upstream master
4. Open the pull request

### Tests

Tests are appreciated, especially when there's logic beyond a simple API call.

### Style

Please adhere to yetibot's existing conventions. A few nitpicks
are 2 spaces, no lines beyond 80 characters wide, and no trailing whitespace.
