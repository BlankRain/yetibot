# yetibot changelog

## 1.0.0

Yetibot 1.0 is here! 1.0 brings non-backward compatible changes.

### Non-backward Compatible Changes

- *Config*: main config is now immutable, and can be provided in
  12-Factor-compatible methods, such as env-vars. As a result, is it also flat
  KV pairs now, which are exploded into nested maps by
  [dec](https://github.com/devth/dec).

  - new [profiles.sample.clj](https://github.com/devth/yetibot.core/blob/master/profiles.sample.clj)
  - new [Configuration docs](https://github.com/devth/yetibot.core/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md)

- *Mutable config*: mutable config, such as which IRC rooms to join and
  channel-specific settings has been extracted into a separate file that is
  managed by Yetibot.

### Removed

- Remove all uses of `config-for-ns` - this was never a good idea.

- Removed Jenkins `add` and `remove` commands in favor of immutable
  configuration and simplified code
