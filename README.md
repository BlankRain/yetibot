# yetibot

You can treat yetibot as a communal command line. It works well for:

 - **teaching**: how to run internal automation, language evaluation for JS,
   Scala, Clojure, and Haskell
 - **productivity**: automating things around Jenkins, JIRA, running SSH
   commands on various servers, and interacting with internal APIs via private
   yetibot plugins
 - **fun**: google image search, gif lookups, meme generation

In addition to a wealth of commands (see `!help all` to view them), it supports
unix-style piping and arbitrarily-nested sub expressions.

## Roadmap

Yetibot has been undergoing continuous improvement since its inception. These
are the immediate priorities, in addition to any bugfixes. Feedback and
contributions are very welcome!

0. Dockerize yetibot and Datomic Pro Starter edition to simplify deployment
0. Integrate with [StackStorm](https://stackstorm.com/) for automation on
   steriods
0. Create a Heroku deploy button to make it easy to get started
0. Run a demo yetibot instance

## Installation

There are two primary ways of installing yetibot:

 1. **Clone this repo**: this gives you a standard yetibot installation and
    provides a git-ignored place to store configuration.
 2. **Make your own repo and depend on yetibot**: this gives you ultimate
    customizability, allowing you to depend on custom yetibot plugins or define
    your own commands in-project, and gives you control over where you store
    your config (manual management, commit to private git repo, etc...)

    ```clojure
    [yetibot "0.1.28"]
    ```

## Configuration

Configuration lives at `config/config.edn`, which is git-ignored. See
[config/config-sample.edn](config/config-sample.edn) for a sample config.
`cp config/config-sample.edn config/config.edn` and fill in the blanks to get started.

## Running

Once configuration is in place, simply `lein run` (requires [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation)).

## Usage

All commands are prefixed by `!`.

### Pipes

Output from one command can be piped to another, like Unix pipes.

```
!complete does IE support | xargs echo %s? No, it is sucky.

does ie support html5? No, it is sucky.
does ie support css3? No, it is sucky.
does ie support svg? No, it is sucky.
does ie support media queries? No, it is sucky.
does ie support ftps? No, it is sucky.
does ie support png? No, it is sucky.
does ie support canvas? No, it is sucky.
does ie support @font-face? No, it is sucky.
does ie support webgl? No, it is sucky.
does ie support ttf? No, it is sucky.
```

### Backticks

Backticks provide a lighweight syntax for sub-expressions, but they can't be
nested.

```
!meme grumpy cat: `catfact` / False
```

<img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/33734863.jpg" />


### Nested sub-expressions

For arbitrarily-nested sub-expressions, use `$(expr)` syntax, which
disambiguates the open and closing of an expressions.

```
!meme chemistry: $(number $(js parseInt('$(weather 98105 | head 2 | tail)')))
```

<img src="http://i.imgflip.com/4xby8.jpg" />


### Combo

```
!echo `repeat 10 echo i don't always repeat myself but | join`â€¦StackOverflowError | meme interesting:
```

<img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/34461434.jpg" />


### Aliases

You can build your own aliases at runtime. These are stored in the configured
database, so upon restart they are restored.

```
!alias nogrid = repeat 3 echo `repeat 3 meme grumpy: no | join`
```

Pipes can be used, but the right-hand side must be quoted in order to treat it
as a literal instead of being evaluated according to normal pipe behavior.

```
!alias i5 = "random | http://icons.wunderground.com/webcamramdisk/w/a/wadot/324/current.jpg?t=%s&.jpg"
```

You can specify placeholder arguments on the right-hand side using `$s` to
indicate all arguments, or `$n` (where n is a 1-based index of which arg).

```
!alias temp = "weather $s | head 2 | tail"
!temp 98104
=> 33.6 F (0.9 C), Overcast
```

### Adapter config

**IRC**: yetibot can listen on any number of channels. You configure
channels in
[config.edn](https://github.com/devth/yetibot/blob/53cb4f01f6b6ad0be3f8061d9297a036453f3b9c/config/config-sample.edn#L33-L34).
You can also invite yetibot to a channel at runtime using the IRC `/invite`
command:

```
/invite yetibot #whoa
```

When you invite yetibot to a new channel, `config.edn` is overwritten, so next
time you restart yetibot, it will re-join the same channels.

You can also use the `!room` command to tell yetibot to join or leave a channel.

```
!help room
room join <room> # join <room>
room leave <room> # leave <room>
room list # list rooms that yetibot is in
room set <key> <value> # configure a setting for the current room
room settings # show all chat settings for this room
room settings <key> # show the value for a single setting
```

**Slack**: bots can't join a channel on their own, they must be invited, so
room configuration doesn't apply. Instead, `/invite @yetibot` to any channel
that you're in, and `/kick @yetibot` if you want it to leave. NB: you might need
special privileges in order to kick.

**Campfire is no longer supported.** If you use Campfire, open an
issue and we can add it back in!

#### Broadcast

If a room has `broadcast` set to `true`, Tweets will be published to that room.
By default all rooms have it set to false. To enable:

```
!room set broadcast true
```

### Help

yetibot self-documents itself using the docstrings of its various commands. Ask it
for `!help` to get a list of help topics. `!help all` shows fully expanded command
list for each topic.

```
!help | join ,
```

```

## Plugins

yetibot has a plugin-based architecture. Its core lives at:
https://github.com/devth/yetibot.core and can be depended on with:

[<img src="http://clojars.org/yetibot.core/latest-version.svg" />](https://clojars.org/yetibot.core)


yetibot will load all commands and observers with namespaces on the classpath
matching the regexes at:
https://github.com/devth/yetibot.core/blob/master/src/yetibot/core/loader.clj#L12-16

This lets you build any number of independent plugin projects and combine them
via standard leiningen dependencies.


## How it works

Curious how the internals of yetibot works? At a high level:

0. commands are run through a parser built on
   [InstaParse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse):
   https://github.com/devth/yetibot.core/blob/master/src/yetibot/core/parser.clj
0. an InstaParse transformer is configured to evaluate expressions through the
   interpreter, which handles things like nested sub-expressions and piped
   commands:
   https://github.com/devth/yetibot.core/blob/master/src/yetibot/core/interpreter.clj
0. [command namespaces](https://github.com/devth/yetibot/tree/master/src/yetibot/commands)
   are `hook`ed into the interpreter's `handle-cmd` function using a `cmd-hook`
   macro and triggered via regex prefix matching:
   https://github.com/devth/yetibot.core/blob/master/src/yetibot/core/hooks.clj
